# Top C Programming Resources

## üèÜ 1. Harvard's CS50 (Introduction to Computer Science)
- **[CS50 on edX](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science)**
- *Taught by David Malan, known for accessible, engaging teaching.*
- Starts in C, then transitions to Python, SQL, and more.
- Emphasizes memory management, pointers, and data structures early.
- Interactive problem sets simulate real-world scenarios (e.g., image filters, spell checkers).

**Best for:**  
- Understanding why C matters, not just how to code in it.  
- Anyone seeking a strong systems-level foundation.

---

## üìò 2. Learn-C.org (Interactive Online Platform)
- **[Learn-C.org](https://www.learn-c.org/)**
- In-browser C compiler ‚Äî no setup needed.
- Covers basics: types, pointers, structs, file I/O, etc.
- Interactive, bite-sized examples.

**Best for:**  
- Rapid, hands-on experimentation.  
- Reinforcing core syntax and concepts.

---

## üß∞ 3. MIT OpenCourseWare ‚Äì "Introduction to C and C++"
- **[MIT 18.S997 (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP63WbdFxL8giv4yhgdMGaZNA)**
- Deep dives into memory layout, pointers, function stacks, and more.
- Taught by MIT faculty with a technical but clear style.

**Best for:**  
- Learners wanting depth (e.g., segmentation faults, malloc internals).  
- Those planning to move into OS or embedded work.

---

## üì¶ 4. Stanford CS107 Lectures (Systems Programming)
- **[CS107 YouTube Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoCMsyE1cvdWKsLVyf6c5pM1hQX0aQn7R)**
- Focuses on low-level programming, C, memory, and assembly.
- Covers debugging, memory models, tools like gdb, valgrind.

**Best for:**  
- Transitioning from high-level languages to thinking about memory and efficiency.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è 5. Google's C++ Class (with C foundations)
- **[Google C++ Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/c++)**
- While focused on C++, initial lessons are a great primer for C programmers.
- Explains memory, pointers, stack vs heap.
- Excellent for procedural to object-oriented transitions.

## üîç Suggested Progression

1. Start with **Learn-C.org** for basic syntax.
2. Take **CS50** or **MIT OCW** to explore structured thinking and memory.
3. Watch **CS107 lectures** for deeper systems understanding.
4. Use **HackerRank / LeetCode** in C for practical problem-solving.
